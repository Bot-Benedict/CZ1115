# Introduction To Data Science and Artificial Intelligence

This was an introductory course named "Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence" taken in Year 1, Semester 1. In this project my team and I explored the [Olympics Data Set obtained from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results). 

## Tasks Performed

The following was done in the notebook by the end of the project:
1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing using numpy, pandas.
2. Data Visualization using seaborn.
3. K-Means Clustering using Sci-Kit Learn.
4. Density Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) using Sci-Kit Learn.
